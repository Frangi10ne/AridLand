# ARIDLAND

Aridland is a project funded under the ESA CCI postdoctoral fellowship. May 2021 - June 2023 

## Overview 

Increasing aridity is one major consequence of ongoing global climate change and is expected to cause widespread changes in key ecosystem attributes, functions, and dynamics. 
This is especially the case in naturally water-limited and vulnerable ecosystems, such as drylands. 
Remote sensing records of vegetation variables and climate are a powerful tool to study ecosystems at the global scale as they are the only comprehensive, long-term, and globally available data source. 
Despite a wealth of publicly available earth observation data, the responses of drylands to increasing aridity and ecosystem-climate sensitivity (i.e., vegetation resistance) remain largely unknown. 
AridLand set out to shed light on the response of various ecosystem state variables to changes in aridity and the resistance of vegetation to increasing aridity (particularly crossing of aridity thresholds) in global drylands.

At first, the project identified that almost half (44.5%) of the tropical dryland area are getting dryer, while only one third (31.6%) are getting wetter. The remaining areas (23.8%) showed no trends in aridity. 
Our results highlight strongest correlations between the ecosystem and aridity in areas with increasing aridity, which matches expectations of systemic acclimatization of the ecosystem to a reduction in water availability (water stress). Under water-related stress, 
we found both positive and negative trends in vegetation. 
Moreover, trends in vegetation were found to be affected differently by potential driving factors (e.g., environmental, and climatic factors, soil properties, population density) in areas experiencing water-related stress as compared to areas 
not exposed to water-related stress.

In the next step, ARIDLAND aims to understand vegetation resistance to crossing aridity thresholds. 
Time series of remote sensing-based vegetation data (NDVI) was linked to field observations of plant and soil properties (distributed across global drylands) to provide an expanded picture of vegetation resistance.
Scripts to calculate resistance, process the data, run the model averaging, and plot results can be found above including the remote sensing-based NDVI and data from field observations that serve as input data.
